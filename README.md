# My dotfiles

These are the dotfiles I use. The software they are supposed to be used with is:

- **sway** - manages your windows
    - **swayidle** - detect idle and then turn off the screen
    - **swaylock** - lock the screen
    - **waybar** - display a nice bar full of information at the top of the screen
    - **swaync** - displays notifications
    - **rofi**  - launch  programs
    - **xdg-desktop-portal** - provide services to programs
- **zathura** - display PDFs
- **foot** - emulates a terminal
    - **zsh** - shell
    - **tmux** - terminal multiplexer
    - **neovim** - text editor
        - **vim-plug** - plugin manager 
- **mpv** - watch videos

## Design philosophy

- High contrast colour scheme with plain white-on-black text and vibrant colours.
- limited amount of bling. I get distracted pretty easily.
    - but at the same time don't be chic-minimalistic for its own sake. Important things
      should stand out, even if the result is ugly as all hell.
- No oh-my-zsh, premade (n)vim configs etc. With those I always had that one feature most
  users found useful but annoys me to no end. I've decided (for now) that it is better
  to have a conf that is half-baked but is fully under my control.
